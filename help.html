<h1>Covid 19 Precautions</h1>
<p>
  
To prevent the spread of COVID-19
<ul>
  <li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
  <li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
  <li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
  <li>Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
  <li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
  <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
  <li>f you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>MASKS</h3>
<p>Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
<h3>SOCAIL DISTANCING</h3>
<p>Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home.

To practice social or physical distancing stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people</p>
<h3><u>FOR OUR CUSTOMERS</u></h3>
<h3>CONTACTLESS DELIVERY </h3>
<p>amidst the current lockdown situation in India, ensuring delivery of safe, hygienic food to our customers is paramount for us. To ensure this, we have launched contactless delivery. Customers can opt to allow the delivery partner to leave the package outside their home, ensuring no human-to-human interaction and hence lowering risk of any transmission.</p>
<h3>Grocery Delivery</h3>
<p> we have started grocery delivery in 80+ cities across India to help with the supply of essentials. Our delivery network in the country is only second to India Post, and we are putting in every effort to make sure that we put it to good use to serve the community. We’d like to thank the government authorities, grocery stores, FMCG companies & other start-ups that have come forward to partner with us and support the community in this endeavour.</p>
<h2><u>For Our Delivery Partners</u></h2>
<h2>Rider Relief Fund</h2>
<p> we have donated money to and are raising funds from the community for the Zomato Rider Relief Fund. This fund is supporting all our delivery partners whose earnings have dropped sharply in the midst of reduced demand for food delivery.</p>
<h2>COVID Insurance</h2>
<p>we have reassured our delivery partners that they don’t need to force themselves to work for financial reasons if they get infected with COVID-19. Zomato’s Delivery Partner Insurance Plan, which earlier covered only hospitalization, will now also cover lost earnings, in case the delivery partner gets infected by COVID-19. </p>
